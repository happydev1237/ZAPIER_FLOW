[Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) helps you automate workflows - it's a free [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)/[Zapier](https://zapier.com/) alternative for developers. With [Actionsflow](https://github.com/actionsflow/actionsflow) you can connect your favorite apps, data, and APIs, receive notifications of actions as they occur, sync files, collect data, and more. We implemented it based on [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and you use a YAML file to build your workflows. The configuration format is the same as [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/configuring-a-workflow), which makes it easy for you to get going if you've explored Github actions before. You can also use any [Github actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) as your job's steps.

I ([@theowenyoung](https://github.com/theowenyoung)) started this project because I needed to perform an action every time a specific RSS feed was updated, but I couldn't find a free platform with support for complicated workflows. I want to thank Github for providing the [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) CI platform for free for open source projects. Leveraging Github actions, Actionsflow provides support for workflows that aren't easily supported by Github actions alone yet.
